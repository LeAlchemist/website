        title: "Blender Tri-Planar Mapping",
        description: "I worked on a quick Tri-Planar node group setup for masking and blending between 2 materials based on coordinate data and upward position. I had created something similar in Unity 3D multiple times in the past, but this is my first time creating it in a 3D modelling/texturing engine for the use of rendering the placement of secondary objects, such as dust, rust, or other details that form due to gravity, downward falling forces (rain), and other physics based effects that I rather not simulate but leave to realtime/baked normals data placement."

After I had created it, I realized that I should of waited til October. <br /> Back in July of 2020 I had the idea to try to paint Substance Painter \"MAT\" a week for the rest of the year, sadly that plan didn't last long due to life events"
