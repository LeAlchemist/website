A selection of 5 simple weapon doodles that i did recently using basic blocked out shapes. I tried to keep the weapons to a basic theme of "what I'd find in a dungeon crawl".
This set of doodles includes a cursed looking sword, a wrapped hilt cleaver, a second cleaver fit for a bandit, a hooked blade, and a battle axe with a gem on top.
