Five basic characters I drew from basic blocked out forms, and decide to have them follow a theme, and what better theme to start with than with "Fantasy", such as what can be seen in Dungeon and Dragons. From left to right, a basic elf, dressed as if he was a ranger or something, an armoured fello holding a spear, a second person holding a spear, but this one is dressed as if he is a roman fighter, a magic man with a tall hat, staff and large bag, and finally a large orc wearing half a skull on one of his shoulders and carrying a large club. Drawing these were fun and I plan to draw more, following different themes.
