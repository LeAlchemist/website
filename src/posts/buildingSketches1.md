I have decided to start sketching some building and thinking about building a small town scene, something with a few buildings. This will give me a chance to practice some larger object modeling, multi sub object material baking, and texture creation due to wanting to make it look stylized. As I sketch more buildings or actually start to model and create the textures for this project
