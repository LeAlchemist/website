<p>Hey look at this, this is the very first post on my website, kinda awesome right? To be absolutely honest, I doubt this post will see the light of day when the site is released, but I wanted to at the very least have something here to test the blog section of my site properly before I go and finalize the purchase of a domain and set up a Cloudflare account (as of writing this, I\'ve already set up a Cloudflare account). Before I get ahead of my self, I should start by stating who I am and what the point of this website.</p>
<p><h3>Who am I</h3></p>
<p>Hi, I am <b>Nicholas Ross</b>, I am a 3D artist, texture designer, and game designer with several years of experience working in freelance designing background props for indie games and animations, along with helping teams prototype gameplay systems and non-programmer oriented systems for writing and design users in Unity 3D. I also have interests in software development using Python, C++, and C#, along with playing with micro controllers for fun DIY projects and simple IoT projects using MicroPython and CircuitPython.</p>
<p><h3>Why did I create this site</h3></p>
<p>I created this site as an excuse to refresh my knowledge of web design while learning responsive web design techniques using Svelte and Svelte kit.</p>
<p><h3>What are my plans</h3></p>
<p>Currently my plans for this site, is to use it as a portfolio for design projects, a place to write about projects that I am doing, be it software, game design, or even some super nerdy physical projects. As of writing this, I do not have any set plans for how often I want to release new content to this site, I currently want to take some time to finalize the basic design of the site, and even update past projects so that I can list them here.</p>
<p>If you read all of this, I would like to say thanks, and I cant wait to share more in the future.</p>
